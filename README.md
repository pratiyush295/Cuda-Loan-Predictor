Here is a sample `README.md` file for your Flask loan prediction app:

# Loan Prediction App

This is a Flask web application that predicts loan eligibility based on user inputs using machine learning models.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for inputting loan application details.
- Prediction of loan eligibility using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Regression models.
- Display of prediction results to the user.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:5000` to access the application.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the application.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates.
  - `landing_page.html`: The landing page template.
  - `home.html`: The main page where users input their loan details.

## Routes

- `/`: Landing page route.
- `/home`: Main page for inputting loan application details.
- `/predict`: Route for processing the loan prediction based on user inputs.

## Loan Prediction Logic

The app collects the following information from the user:

- Gender
- Marital status
- Number of dependents
- Education level
- Employment status
- Applicant income
- Coapplicant income
- Loan amount
- Loan term
- Credit history
- Property area

Based on these inputs, the app uses pre-trained machine learning models to predict loan eligibility. The models used are:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Regression

## Machine Learning Models

The models are pre-trained and saved as `model_rf` (Random Forest). The `joblib` library is used to load these models for prediction.

## Dependencies

The app requires the following Python packages:

```
click==8.1.3
colorama==0.4.6
Flask==2.2.3
gunicorn==20.1.0
itsdangerous==2.1.2
